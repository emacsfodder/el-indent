my-indent --- `indent-line-function' configurator

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

my-indent allows to quckly build `indent-line-function' for chosen mode.
It may be helpful if you'd like to customize way code is indented in mode
you're using or you're writing support for a new mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Put el-kit files (see my other projects) into folder named 'el-kit' within
  your .emacs load path.

- Put my-indent in same path

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 How to use ready configurations ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Load feature and add hook to your mode, e.g. for lisp-mode:

(require 'my-indent/lisp)
(add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook 'my-indent-set-lisp)

Naming convention for other modes stays the same. For xml-mode will be:
my-indent/xml and `my-indent-set-xml etc..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 How to configure your own indent function ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To configure 'indent-line-function you need to provide list of strings that
affects indentation.

Example - let's say we deal with mode in which code is nested by parenthesis.
So '(' nests +1 and ')' nests -1, we configure rules that way:

(list
	(list "\(" "\)")
	(list 1    -1)
	(list t    t))

In first list you group strings (in form of regexps) that affect
indentation. In second you say which way it affects indentation
and in third list you say what rules should be followed after that string in
code occured. If it's same rules then you may just put t. otherwise you
should put object with differnt rules that would be used afterwards.

Sometimes in first group you'll put string that change the rules
of indentation but actually doesn't indent the code. For example beginning of
comments might be the case, then just put 0 in second list.

Finally you'll pack rules into functions for direct use:

(setq my-indent-exp-mymode
	(my-indent-build-exps
		(list
			(list "\(" "\)")
			(list 1    -1)
			(list t    t))))

; my-indent-build-exps translates your rules into expressions that are
evaluated when actually indenting.

(defun my-indent-mymode ()
	(my-indent-line (lambda () my-indent-exp-mymode)))

; In place of lambda you may put your custom function that will return different
; expressions according to place in which indent is calculated

(defun my-indent-set-mymode ()
	(setq indent-line-function 'my-indent-mymode))

And that's it, such configuration may be used in way described in 'How to use
ready configurations ?' part.

Indent rules are generally more complicated than in this example. You can learn
more from configurations that are included with this project.
